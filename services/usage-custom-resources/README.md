# Example for Using CloudFormation Custom Resources

When you deploy [the custom-resources service][crsvc], it creates a Lambda function that
can be used as a service token in other CloudFormation stacks that need to create custom
resources.

This "service" demonstrates the use of one of the custom resources. You can copy this
example and modify your template to use any of the other custom resources.

[crsvc]: ../custom-resources/
